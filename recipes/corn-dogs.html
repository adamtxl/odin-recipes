<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ahh, comfort food. Should this be a mainstay in your diet? No. But every once in a while? Sure, it's just not a lot of protein for what you're getting.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>12 hot dogs(or brats)</li>
    <li> 12 sticks</li>
    <li> Peanut, Canola, or Vegetable Oil for frying</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups fine yellow corn meal</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp honey</li></ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Pour 2-3” of oil in a large pot or dutch oven and heat to 350˚F over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Pat dry with paper towels. Insert sticks into hot dogs.</li>
    <li>Whisk together dry ingredients (corn meal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt). Whisk together wet ingredients (buttermilk, egg, 1 Tbsp oil and honey). Combine wet and dry ingredients and whisk to combine.</li>
    <li>Pour batter into a drinking glass almost to the top and dip hot dogs. Put corndog straight down into batter and give it a little twirl to fully coat the hot dogs then swirl as you lift up. Let excess drip off. </li>
    <li>Hold corn dog at an angle in the hot oil for 5-7 seconds to let it seal then drop into oil (this keeps them from sticking to the bottom of the pot). </li>
    <li>Fry 3 minutes or until golden brown. Fry up to 2-3 at a time (so you don’t drop the temperature), turning them as needed to brown evenly. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. </li></ol>
