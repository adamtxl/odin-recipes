<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Need a quick pick me up when you're busting your ass doing Keto? Well look no further, these balls are packed with taste and enough fat to power your next workout or keep the hangry monster at bay for another hour or two.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Â½ cup peanut butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspone Stevia Glycerite</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
    <li>Pinch of Sea Salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine the peanut butter, sweetener, and cocoa powder in a medium bowl.
    </li>
    <li>Mix the ingredients with a fork or rubber spatula until smooth. The mixture will be very thick. It should have the texture of edible playdough.
    </li>
    <li>Use a scant cookie scoop (a 2-tablespoon scoop) to portion the mixture, then shape each portion into a smooth ball with your hands. If you use stevia, you should get six balls. With a powdered sweetener, you should get seven.</li>
    <li>Store the fat bombs in an airtight container on the counter for up to two days. If your kitchen is hot or for longer storage (up to 5 days), store them in the fridge. Remove them from the fridge an hour before enjoying them to allow them to soften.</li>
